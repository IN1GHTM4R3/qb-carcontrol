## If you want to combine it in to an already made resource like qb-smallresources just rename "main.lua" to "cl_carcontrol.lua" and add make sure to add it in--> @qb-smallresources --> client / update as well as update the fxmanifest of qb-smallresources, if you do this.

`To add qb-carcontrol in to your Radial Menu, open qb-radialmenu/config.lua file and (Add+) this snippet below into the config file under the vehicle section. It will open the qb-carcontrol menu while you are in a vehicle. `

```
       	   {
                id = 'vehiclemenu',
                title = 'Car Control',
                icon = 'bars',
                type = 'client',
                event = 'ccvehmenu:client:openMenu',
                shouldClose = true
            }
```
`Place the above snippet inside this radialmenu section titled "vehicle" [3] = {`

``` 
    [3] = {
        id = 'vehicle',
        title = 'Vehicle',
        icon = 'car',
        items = {
        {
    }
``` 
            
`should line up in the config section right above selection #4 inside the qb-radialmenu/config, this will add it to the correct vehicle section #3`    
            
``` 
    [4] = {
        id = 'jobinteractions',
        title = 'Work',
        icon = 'briefcase',
        items = {}
    }
```
